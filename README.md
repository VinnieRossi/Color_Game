# Color_Game
Small and simple mobile game created to practice mobile development

## How to play
The point of the game is simple: Click the colored dots to gain points! The smaller the dot, the more points it rewards you.
But be careful, every time you miss you lose a life. You start with 4 lives (3 spares), and once they're all used up then the game ends.

## Game info
You gain an extra life at 10k points and at 25k points. 

As time goes on, the circles will get smaller and the rewards will be larger. But the circles will also spawn faster.
If too many circles overwhelm the map then the game will end.

## Settings
Currently the only settings you're able to change are the basic ones. You can turn sounds on/off, as well as select between a few different
color schemes for the dots. There are no powerups yet so that setting does nothing. There are also no challenges yet, so the only available 
play mode is "Quick Play".
